    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      A wildlife researcher and explorer with a relentless curiosity for the hidden corners of Nepal’s wilderness. Like an explorer chasing the mysteries of the deep, I embark on expeditions through jungles, mountains, and rivers, uncovering the untold stories of species that shape our ecosystems. My journey takes me from studying the vibrant fish species in Nepal’s rivers to working with the endangered gharials of the Terai. This journey isn’t just about discovering nature—it’s about understanding it, protecting it, and inspiring others to join in. From the tigers of Terai to the birds of Langtang, every discovery brings us one step closer to a wilder, sustainable world.

 <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center"> How It Started </h2>
 </div>

     <p class=" bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
     Growing up in the heart of Chitwan, surrounded by farmland and the wilderness of Chitwan National Park, wildlife was an integral part of my life. The frequent raids on our fields by wild boars, one-horned rhinos, and other creatures were part of the everyday reality. However, it was the heartbreaking sight of a rhino being electrocuted nearby my home, when I was 8, that truly shaped my path. When national park officials arrived and performed an autopsy, revealing a small rhino in the mother’s womb, it deeply affected me.
     While others around me focused on academic subjects like algebra and trigonometry, I found more joy in the animals on our farm and the stories they told. I would observe how tailor birds built their nests, how a woodpecker pecks the bark of tree to search for the insects inside it, and how great hornbills seal the tree cavity for raising the chicks. These natural marvels sparked a curiosity that drove me toward studying science. 
      <br/>
      Despite being selected for the study of Medicine program, I chose a different path—one focused on understanding, conserving, and advocating for wildlife.

      As my studies in Environmental Science with a focus on biodiversity progressed, my passion deepened. I began working on research in river ecosystems, ichthyofauna, and gharials in the Terai, and began utilizing camera trapping—a childhood dream come true—to uncover the hidden species in the forests, including small mammals that lit the fire inside me. I also had the opportunity to work on the rehabilitation of captive Asian elephants, helping them recover from their traumatic experiences in the tourism industry with positive reinforment training. My work with tigers, small mammals, and other wildlife continues to fuel my mission to protect and conserve Nepal's incredible biodiversity.

 <p class=" bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"> I have a deep appreciation for life's simple joys, much like a traditional Nepali. From brewing a perfect cup of coffee to spending time with my dogs, these small moments of comfort fuel my day. I find fulfillment in nurturing life—whether it's tending to plants, creating something from the earth, or connecting with nature’s rhythms. These practices remind me of the cyclical beauty of life and the healing powers nature has to offer, keeping me grounded, balanced, and ever in harmony with the world around me.</p>
